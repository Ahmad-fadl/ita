This is where the long tweets go to. They replace the former dir 'Hydrated_Tweets', the tweets there were cut off.   
Twitter-Access was updated, so now the long tweets will be hydrated (but that will have a longer duration) using another extraction method.
For further use - after hydrating - you should rename this folder back to Hydrated_Tweets, so the further processing uses these tweets, not the short ones.
