# Text Analytics Project

This is the readme for `src/data/Preoprocessed_Tweets`.
This directory should be empty at the beginning. This is where the preprocessed tweets will go to.  
Due to twitters user guidlines you are not allowed to pass the original tweets, so you need to repeat the hydration by your own.   
This is currently managed in `src/Twitter-Access.py`.  
See main readme, and readme in `Hydrated_Tweets`
