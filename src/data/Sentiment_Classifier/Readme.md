# Text Analytics Project

This is the readme for `src/data/Sentiment_Classifier`. Here you find two lexicons the text classification is based on. The emotion lexicon is taken from https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm, the subjectivity lexicon from https://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_lexicon/.
