# Data for the Sentiment Classifier
This is the readme for `src/data/Sentiment_Classifier`.  
In this directory you find two lexicons the text classification is based on and another file (???) **TODO**


## Emotion Lexicon Wordlevel -  basic idea and data structure
- The NRC Emotion Lexicon is taken from https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm and saved as ``src/data/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Wordlevel-v0.92.txt``.

- "The NRC Emotion Lexicon is a list of English words and their associations with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive). The annotations were manually done by crowdsourcing." ([source](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm))  

##  Subjectivity Lexicon -  basic idea and data structure
- The MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon is taken from https://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_lexicon/ and saved as `src/data/Sentiment_Classifier/subjclueslen1-HLTEMNLP05.tff`.  
- entries in the lexicon (words) are labeled as strong or weak subjective. 



## Troubleshooting / FAQ
- N.A

## TODO'S 
- rename files to a more intuitively name? Like Senslevel_Emotion_Lexicon and Wordlevel_Emotion_Lexicon and Subjectivity_Lexicon ?
